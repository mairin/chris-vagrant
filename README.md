ChRIS setup via vagrant and ansible

This is based on Fedora. As-is, will work with Fedora 29+. To get started, clone this repo and then just run vagrant-up. (You'll need vagrant and ansible installed.)

With Fedora 28 and older, you'll need vagrant and ansible-python3 installed. Clone this repo. Rename 'Vagrantfile' to 'Vagrantfile-F29' and rename 'Vagrantfile-F28' to 'Vagrantfile'. Then run vagrant-up.
